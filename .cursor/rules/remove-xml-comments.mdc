# Remove XML Comments from C# Files

When asked to remove XML comments (comments starting with `///`) from C# files, use the following approach:

1. Read the entire file to understand its structure
2. Delete the original file
3. Create a new file with the same name containing the same code but without XML comments

Example of XML comments to remove:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Description of the class/method
/// </summary>
/// <param name="paramName">Description of the parameter</param>
/// <returns>Description of the return value</returns>
```

This approach avoids formatting issues that can occur when trying to use search/replace operations to remove individual comment blocks.
