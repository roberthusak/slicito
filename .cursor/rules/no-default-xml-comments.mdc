# No Default XML Comments

When generating or modifying code, do not automatically add XML documentation comments unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Examples

❌ Don't do this by default:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the name.
/// </summary>
public string Name { get; set; }
```

✅ Do this instead:
```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

## When to Add XML Comments

Only add XML documentation comments when:
1. The user explicitly requests them
2. The user asks for documentation
3. The user specifically mentions wanting XML comments

## Note

This rule applies to all code generation and modification tasks. XML comments should be treated as an opt-in feature rather than a default behavior.
